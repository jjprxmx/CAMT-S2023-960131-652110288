    <h2>Lipstick Mac</h2>
    <p>The lips are the visible body part at the mouth of many animals, including humans.<br>
        Lips are soft, movable, and serve as the opening for food intake and in the articulation of sound and speech.<br>
        Human lips are a tactile sensory organ, and can be an erogenous zone when used in kissing and other acts of intimacy.</p>

    <p>The upper and lower lips are referred to as the <u>"Labium superius oris" and "Labium inferius oris"</u> <br>
        respectively.The juncture where the lips meet the surrounding skin of the mouth area is the vermilion border,<br>
        and the typically reddish area within the borders is called the vermilion zone.<br>
        The vermilion border of the upper lip is known as <b>the cupid's bow.</b> </p>
    
    <h3>Let joy with Lips</h3>
    <p>The skin of the lip, with three to five cellular layers, is very thin compared to typical face skin<br>
        , which has up to 16 layers. With light skin color,the lip skin contains fewer melanocytes<br> 
        (cells which produce melanin pigment, which give skin its color)</p>
